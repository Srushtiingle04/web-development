            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (Bhīmrāo Rāmjī Āmbēḍkar; 14 April 1891 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.]</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>[Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh).[3] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[4] His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.[5] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.[6] Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".[7] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.[8]

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his father registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri district.[9][10][11][12] His Marathi Brahmin teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records]</p>

            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>[Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar's contributions towards eliminating the caste-based discrimination from the society:

Drafting the Indian Constitution: As the chairman of the Drafting Committee, Ambedkar played a crucial role in drafting the Indian Constitution, which enshrined the principles of equality, liberty, and fraternity and outlawed caste-based discrimination through various provisions, specially under Fundamental Rights under articles 14 to 18. It also provided a framework for social and economic justice under Directive principals of State policy as well.
Campaign for Social Equality: Ambedkar was a vocal critic of the caste system and campaigned for social equality. He founded the "Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha" in 1924 to work for the welfare of the untouchables and later established the "All India Scheduled Castes Federation" to represent the interests of the marginalized sections of society. He also led the Mahad Satyagrah in 1927 which is considered to be the “foundational event” of the Dalit movement. Earlier in 1930, he had led around 15000 Dalits to enter the Kalaram Temple to help them see God for the first time.
Provision of Reservation System: Ambedkar proposed the reservation system, which ensured that a certain percentage of government jobs and educational seats were reserved for the socially and economically backward sections of society. This helped to provide access to education and employment opportunities to these sections and uplift them socially and economically.
Ambedkar signed the Poona Pact with Mahatma Gandhi in 1932, facilitating the reservation of seats for Dalits (then known as Depressed Classes).
Educational Reforms: Ambedkar emphasized the importance of education in addressing social inequality and worked to establish educational institutions for the marginalized sections of society.]</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>[Ambedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India.[105][106] In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education and affirmative action through socio-economic and legal incentives. His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India's first law minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial and unpopular among Hindus.[107] His conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad.[108]

Many public institutions are named in his honour, and the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport in Nagpur, otherwise known as Sonegaon Airport. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, Ambedkar University Delhi is also named in his honour.[109]

The Maharashtra government has acquired a house in London where Ambedkar lived during his days as a student in the 1920s. The house is expected to be converted into a museum-cum-memorial to Ambedkar.[110]

Ambedkar was voted "the Greatest Indian" since independence by a poll organised by History TV18 and CNN IBN, ahead of Patel and Nehru, in 2012. Nearly 20 million votes were cast.[111] Due to his role in economics, Narendra Jadhav, a notable Indian economist,[112] has said that Ambedkar was "the highest educated Indian economist of all times."[113] Amartya Sen, said that Ambedkar is "father of my economics", and "he was highly controversial figure in his home country, though it was not the reality. His contribution in the field of economics is marvelous and will be remembered forever."[114][115]

On 2 April 1967, an 3.66 metre (12 foot) tall bronze statue of Ambedkar was installed in the Parliament of India. The statue, sculpted by B.V. Wagh, was unveiled by the then President of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.[116][117][118] On 12 April 1990, a portrait of B.R. Ambedkar is put in the Central Hall of Parliament House.[119][120][121] The portrait of Ambedkar, painted by Zeba Amrohawi, was unveiled by the then Prime Minister of India, V. P. Singh.[119] Another portrait of Ambedkar is put in the Parliamentary Museum and archives of the Parliament House.[122][123]

Ambedkar's legacy was not without criticism. Ambedkar has been criticised for his one-sided views on the issue of caste at the expense of cooperation with the larger nationalist movement.[124] Ambedkar has been also criticised by some of his biographers over his neglect of organization-building.[125]

The Citizens paid tributes to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar on the occasion of his 125th birth anniversary, at Parliament House, in New Delhi on 14 April 2016
PM Manmohan Singh, the Speaker, Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee and the leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, L. K. Advani paid tributes at the portrait of B. R. Ambedkar

Ambedkar's political philosophy has given rise to a large number of political parties, publications and workers' unions that remain active across India, especially in Maharashtra. His promotion of Buddhism has rejuvenated interest in Buddhist philosophy among sections of population in India. Mass conversion ceremonies have been organised by human rights activists in modern times, emulating Ambedkar's Nagpur ceremony of 1956.[126] Some Indian Buddhists regard him as a Bodhisattva, although he never claimed it himself.[127] Outside India, during the late 1990s, some Hungarian Romani people drew parallels between their own situation and that of the downtrodden people in India. Inspired by Ambedkar, they started to convert to Buddhism.[128]

The Ambedkar Statue in Hyderabad is a statue of B. R. Ambedkar located in Hyderabad. The statue was designed by Ram V. Sutar. The foundation stone was laid in 2016, but the construction of the statue began in 2021. The statue was inaugurated on 14 April 2023, by K. Chandrashekhar Rao, the Chief Minister of Telangana, on the 132nd Ambedkar Jayanti. Ambedkar's grandson Prakash Ambedkar was the chief guest of the event. The statue is made up of over 360 tonnes of steel and 100 tonnes of bronze.[129][130][131][132][133]]</p>
